# candy-collector-game
A fun game with simple math that implements randomized values in jQuery

## Description

This project is a fun simple math game. The game will automatically generate 4 random values and assign them to the 4 available buttons (lollipops, bubblegum, jelly beans, and gummy bears). Values associated with each button will be added to the starting value of "0" upon each click. The user's goal is to click the buttons to determine what values are added by pressing each button, and using the knowledge of the value of the buttons and simple math, click the buttons until the goal number is achieved. Surpass that number and user loses, land on that exact number and user wins!!
